# mapsync
Automatic mapping between two set of text values, based on semantic similarity. Like AutoMapper, but for values.

## Proof of concept

Experiments
- [x] <del>A first POC with word2vec</del> (abandonned: too complex to find proper weights for French)
- [x] A second POC with [Spacy](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#vectors-similarity)

TODO
- [ ] A second POC with using a LLM to generate the embeddings
